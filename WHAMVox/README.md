# WHAMVox

This repository contains files, notebooks and script necessary to generate the 
`WHAMVox` test dataset used in _**Restoring speech intelligibility for hearing aid users using deep learning**_.

The `analyses.ipynb` Notebook analyses raw speech and noise data in order to 
select a subset of speech and noise files which we want to use for the dataset 
generation.

That script also generates a CSV file containing a list of paired speech and noise 
files.

This CSV file is used by the `WHAMVox_test.py` script to generate the actual 
evaluation set. Variants of the evaluation set can be generated by specifying 
additional parameters to this script.

# WHAMVox Test Set

This test set is a mix of speech files from the VoxCeleb2 [1] test set and the
WHAM! [2] noise recordings test set.

## Steps to reproduce the test set used in _**Restoring speech intelligibility for hearing aid users using deep learning**_: 

1. Download the speech and noise datasets from [1] and [2] (for VoxCeleb, you only need to download the test part) and unzip.
2. Install the pip requirements listed below
3. Call the _generate_WHAMVox_testset.py_ script from the command line, specifying paths to the downloaded files/folders
4. For more information about arguments that can be passed to the script, call ```python3 generate_WHAMVox_testset.py --help``` from the command line

## Requirements:

The following requirements need to installed for this script to run:
```
audioread==2.1.9
librosa==0.8.0
numpy~=1.19.4
pandas~=1.2.0
scipy~=1.6.0
soundfile
```
