## The WHAMVox Dataset

WHAMVox contains two subsets, each with 1940 files. 
_WHAMVox easy_ covers the SNR range -20dB to 20dB SNR
_WHAMVox hard_ covers the SNR range -27dB to 12dB SNR

Each sound file consists of mixed speech from the [VoxCeleb2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) and noise from the [WHAM!](https://wham.whisper.ai/) test datasets. Corresponding clean speech files are included for each example.
