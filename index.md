# The WHAMVox Dataset

WHAMVox contains two subsets, each with 1940 files. 
\**WHAMVox easy** covers the SNR range -20dB to 20dB SNR
\**WHAMVox hard** covers the SNR range -27dB to 12dB SNR

Each sound file consists of mixed speech from the [VoxCeleb2](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) \[1] and noise from the [WHAM!](https://wham.whisper.ai/) \[2] test datasets. Corresponding clean speech files are included for each example.

**WHAMVox easy** can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/yossing-audatic/noisy_speech_test_sets/blob/main/WHAMVox/WHAMVox_easy.zip)

**WHAMVox hard** can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/yossing-audatic/noisy_speech_test_sets/blob/main/WHAMVox/WHAMVox_hard.zip)

metadata containing the ids and paths of the speech and noise files for each example as well as the URL to the original speech videos can be found [here](https://github.com/yossing-audatic/noisy_speech_test_sets/blob/main/WHAMVox/WHAMVox_test.csv)
